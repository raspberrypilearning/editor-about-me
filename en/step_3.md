<h2 class="c-project-heading--explainer">Using three <code>'</code></h2>

Sometimes you want to print more than one line.

You can do this by using three quotation marks: `'''`

<div class="c-project-code">
--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 3-7
---
print('Hi, I can code in Python!')

print('''
here's a picture of a dog:
o____ 
 ||||
 ''')
--- /code ---
</div>

<div class="c-project-output">
<pre>o____ 
 ||||
</pre>
</div>

<div class="c-project-callout c-project-callout--tip">

### Tip

ASCII art means making pictures using letters and symbols.

The legs of the dog use the *pipe* symbol.  
You can find this using <kbd>Shift + \</kbd>.
