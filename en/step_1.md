<h2 class="c-project-heading--task">Say Hello!</h2>
--- task ---
Use Python to write some text.
--- /task ---

<h2 class="c-project-heading--explainer">Printing</h2>

You can use the `print()` function in Python to show text on the screen.

Add the code below.  
Then click the *Run* button.

<div class="c-project-code">
--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
---
print('Hello!')
--- /code ---
</div>

<div class="c-project-output">
<pre>Hello!</pre>
</div>

<div class="c-project-callout c-project-callout--tip">

### Tip

Parentheses `()` are the round brackets used in code.  
Quotation marks `''` tell Python what text to show.

Try this:
- Delete one `(` or `)` and click *Run*
- Delete one `'` and click *Run*

</div>

<div class="c-project-callout c-project-callout--debug">

### Debugging

If something goes wrong, don’t worry.  
This usually means there is a small mistake.

Python will show an error message.  
At first, these messages might be confusing. That’s OK!  
You will learn what they mean as you practise.
